# Extending OpenStack
This is the code repository for [Learning AWS IoT](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-aws-iot?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781788396110), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
OpenStack is a very popular cloud computing platform that has enabled several organizations to successfully implement their Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms in the last few years. This book will guide you through new features of the latest OpenStack releases and how to bring them into production straight away in an agile way. It starts by showing you how to expand your current OpenStack setup and approach your next OpenStack Data Center generation deployment. You will discover how to extend your storage and network capacity, and also take advantage of containerization technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes in OpenStack. In addition, it is an opportunity to explore the power of big data as a service implemented in OpenStack by integrating the Sahara project. 

This book will teach you how to build Hadoop clusters and launch jobs in a very simple way. Then, it will dedicate time to automating and deploying applications on top of OpenStack. You will discover how to create and publish your own application in simple steps using the novel application catalog service in OpenStack code named Murano. The final part of the book will shed the light on the identity service and will go through a consolidated authentication setup using Keystone. The book will be enclosed by leveraging the right tool to conduct and extend benchmarking performances tests against an operating OpenStack environment using the Rally platform. 

By the end of this book, you will be ready to enter the next phase of OpenStack success by extending and customizing your private cloud based on your requirements.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
# Compute Hosts 
    compute_hosts:
    ... 
      compute-02: 
        ip: 172.16.0.105
```
## Hardware and Software Requirements

The OpenStack installation will require the following hardware specifications:
•	A host machine with CPU hardware virtualization support
•	8 CPU cores
•	16 GB RAM
•	60 GB free disk space

The lab environment uses the following software and tools:
•	Operating system: CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 14.04
•	OpenStack: Mitaka and later releases
•	VirtualBox 5.0 or newer
•	Vagrant 2.0.1 or newer
•	Ansible server 2.4 or newer
•	Python 2.7
